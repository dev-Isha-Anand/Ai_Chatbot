Logistics Coordinator- US Shift,"https://www.glassdoor.co.in/job-listing/logistics-coordinator-us-shift-fictiv-JV_IC2940587_KO0,30_KE31,37.htm?jl=1009776146596",Fictiv3.7,Bengaluru,₹2L - ₹5L (Glassdoor Est.),"Fictiv Exists to Enable Hardware Innovators to Build Better Products, Faster

Fictiv, coined the ""AWS of manufacturing,"" is a leading technology company transforming the $350 billion manufacturing industry. Our cutting-edge cloud platform uses AI and machine learning algorithms to help companies build hardware at the speed of software. Come join our growing team!
What's in it for you?
List at least two comparative wins for this role over another that someone might consider. Example follows.
Opportunity To Unlock Your Creativity
Think of all the times you were held back from trying new ideas because you were boxed in by bureaucratic legacy processes or old school tactics. Having a growth mindset is deeply ingrained into our company culture since day 1 so Fictiv is an environment where you have the creative liberty and support of the team to try big bold ideas to achieve our sales and customer goals.
Opportunity To Grow Your Career
There are plenty of sales jobs out there. The question is whether any of them will help you grow in your career? Will you be challenged by teammates to achieve your potential? Or are they roles that will ask you to do more of what you've already mastered. At Fictiv, you'll be surrounded by supportive teammates who will push you to be your best through their curiosity and passion.

Your role as a Logistics Coordinator, GCC will be to support and drive improvement to our critical manufacturing functions. We have two sets of customers - our builders, who order parts through us, and our manufacturing partners, who manufacture and assemble these parts - and you'll take the inputs from our builders and work with our manufacturing partners to deliver on our builders' expectations. At Fictiv, we believe in creating and empowering product innovators to create, and you'll be playing a critical role in making that happen.

What is in it for you?
This role provides a high-impact opportunity for professionals who want to go beyond traditional logistics roles. Comparative advantages include:
Strategic Influence Over Operations:
Unlike typical logistics roles that are limited to execution, this position involves direct interaction with cross-functional teams, exception management, and carrier performance tracking, providing exposure to strategic decision-making and business process improvements.
Ownership and Visibility:
Rather than working in a siloed environment, this role offers end-to-end ownership over order fulfillment, from documentation to delivery. This increases personal accountability, but also offers greater visibility into business outcomes, contributing to faster career growth and deeper functional expertise.
Impact in this Role
This Logistics Coordinator role is instrumental in ensuring operational excellence across our US logistics network.

We recognize that impactful team members come from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. If this role sounds exciting, even if you don't meet every listed requirement, we encourage you to apply. Research shows that women often hold back unless they meet 100% of the criteria, while men tend to apply with only 60%. We value drive, adaptability, and a learning mindset just as much as direct experience.
What You'll Be Doing
Coordinating US domestic and US Export shipments: Prepare shipping documentation and ensure that our products are sent to our customers on time.
Order Tracking: Maintain visibility of the status of all our orders and determine risk mitigation strategies to maximize the chance of on-time delivery.
File claims and troubleshoot issues with carriers for damaged and lost products to ensure resolutions and reimbursements. You will also be responsible for supporting issues of routing, direct ship pickups, and carrier scheduling. When necessary, coordinate pickups, using courier services from our manufacturing partners to our customers.
Exception Management: Manage the shipping exceptions. As manufacturing exceptions arise, coordinate with the customer success team and our manufacturing partners to determine the shipping method that best meets our customers' needs to deliver the goods on time.
Develop and maintain key metrics to keep track of performance against KPIs for US-based logistics.
Collaborate with other departments to ensure seamless and efficient integration of logistics processes with end-to-end company workflows.
Validate logistics partner invoices to ensure accuracy and compliance with agreed rates.
Conduct monthly Freight Cost Analysis, identifying cost trends and areas for optimization.
Continuous Improvement and Training.
Provide recommendations to reduce logistics expenses while maintaining service efficiency
Identifying areas of improvement within North American logistics operations, suggesting management solutions, and, when applicable, owning the successful completion of those continuous improvement exercises.
At Fictiv, everybody learns from other members. Take the time to analyze and understand Fictiv's current business operations and share your knowledge with other team members.
Desired Traits
Beyond core Fictiv values, the following traits will be prioritized during the interview process, as they closely align with success in this role and reflect the expectations of key stakeholder personas:
